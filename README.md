# Travel-note
Minimalist and fast travel notebook, where to store the sites you visit, georeferenced, commented and illustrated, to return to them when you want and share it with your friends and other users.

If you have gone to visit a pub, restaurant, etc ... and have to find where to write your address, and a reference of why you want to go back to it, and also take a picture to remember it and your life has complicated using google maps , notes and the camera to write it down, this is the application you need.

If in addition you have happened that after your trip a friend or relative has asked you which sites to visit, and do not remember it or you have to look for the information, to make a list, this is your application.

And if you have also spent wanting your trip, and pull memory, photo galleries and others, and would like to do it easily and also by sharing it on social networks, this is your application.

Travels
Your trips, reduced to the minimum expression, because less is more. You can create a new trip and make a package, or not so small description of your trip, put a date, and list the countries you are going to visit. This will help others to find "your travel" to use as a reference.

A travel is like a travel notebook.

Pads
Create an annotation quickly, do not waste time asking where you are, simply create an automatically geolocated pad and title it, and if you want add a longer description and a photo, and mark if this visit will be visible to the rest. The date and time will be saved automatically.
